# hello-world
This is my first repository



My Name is Paul, this is my first time coding on GitHub,
I am a bit new to the whole coding this but, hey if i have gotten this far, 
what is there to stop me from going father. Well money. and Time. 
They could both stop me. 


So one year later i am here learning again. I have gained alot more knowlege. 
I am hoping i can really start marking more progress faster as time goes by.
